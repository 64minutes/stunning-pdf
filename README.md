# stunning-pdf<br>

<p>Code I programmed to automate tasks for my work.<br>
Extracts website links from an external spreadsheet, creates directories for each indivdual person, and finally uses Selenium to access each site to save offline PDFs.<br></p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <h2>Future Implementations</h2>
    <li>Environment variables to read path directories</li>
    <li>Use logging instead of printing to console for alerts when unable to access website / print PDF</li>
  </ul>
</p>
