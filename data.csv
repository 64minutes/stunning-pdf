The search results provide biographical details about Paul Renner, including:

    His background as a lawyer, former prosecutor, and military veteran 

His current role as Speaker of the Florida House starting in November 2022 Previous positions he has held in the Florida House since being elected in 2015 Details about his education, family, and district he represents However, there is no mention in any of the results about Renner's PEP status, risk rating as a PEP, or any enhanced due diligence procedures financial institutions would need to follow related to his prominent elected position. As the Speaker of the Florida House, one of the highest and most powerful positions in state government, it is very likely that Paul Renner would be considered a politically exposed person by banks and face heightened scrutiny of his transactions and sources of wealth. But the provided search results do not explicitly confirm his PEP designation or provide the specific types of information typically used to identify, risk rate, and monitor PEPs under anti-money laundering regulations. While his position would suggest a high probability of being a PEP, there are no definitive statements about his status or associated compliance requirements in the search results. More information from official sources may be needed to conclusively determine his PEP classification.

Based on the provided search results, Paul Renner is an USA lawyer and Republican politician who currently serves as the Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Here are the key details about him: Paul Marvin Renner (born March 21, 1967) is the 103rd Speaker of the Florida House, assuming that position in November 2022.
